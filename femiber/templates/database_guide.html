                    This is an abbreviated guide to <em>FEMIber CrCast</em>, a relational database generated within the project
                    “Digitizing Women of Medieval Iberian Historiography” (also known as “FEMIber”), conducted by
                    Marija Blašković at the Department of Humanities, University Pompeu Fabra in Barcelona, Spain. The
                    database’s source material is the anonymous <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cr%C3%B3nica_de_Castilla" target="_blank"><em>Crónica de Castilla</em></a> (ca. 1300, Castile-León), edited by
                    <a href="https://books.openedition.org/esb/63" target="_blank">Patricia Rochwert-Zuili</a> in 2010.

                    This project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation
                    program under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie grant agreement No 101064789. The database design was
                    influenced by the codebooks and protocols employed in the <a href="https://medievallondoners.ace.fordham.edu/search/" target="_blank"><em>Medieval Londoners Database</em></a> and the
                    </a><em>Prosopography of Anglo-Saxon England (<a href="https://pase.ac.uk/" target="_blank">PASE</a>)</em>.

                    <tr>
                        <td>Standard Name</td>
                        <td>
                            The woman’s name is given in standardized Spanish (e.g., Isabel instead of Elisabeth; Juana instead of Joan), followed by a descriptor such as “wife of” or “daughter of” in the case of individuals or an expression that highlights ties to other people and/or places in the case of groups.<br>
                            When the same individual was recorded with different names throughout history, the database uses the one deemed most recognizable. If women are not mentioned in earlier historiography, the name in the <em>Crónica de Castilla</em> is their <u>Standard Name</u>; if the work’s manuscripts contain different names, these will be alphabetized and hyphenated. Arabic numbers are assigned in order of entry to women with the same forename and anonymous individuals/groups to disambiguate them.<br>
                            Regarding the names of peninsular kings and noblemen who function as descriptors, they appear in their Spanish form. Regnal numbers and the names of the territories they ruled are used to ensure proper identification. For Muslim rulers, a shorter form of their Arabic names is used. Men of foreign origin who lived on the Iberian Peninsula will be listed under their Hispanicized names (Enrique instead of Henry, Ramón instead of Raymond). If men who did not live on the Iberian Peninsula are mentioned, their names will be Anglicized (e.g., William of Ponthieu, Raymond of Savoy).

                        <td>Names/name variants and, if available, patronymics as they appear in the <em>Crónica de Castilla</em>, together with the textual reference in brackets. The value none signifies that the name is omitted either in the person’s first mention or throughout the chronicle.</td>

                        <td>
                            This field records the information available on the woman’s blood relatives. The possible values are <strong>mother, father, sister(s), brother(s)</strong> (both including step- siblings), and <strong>other(s)</strong> (used for relatives such as grandparents, cousins, uncles, aunts, etc.). Values are entered when women’s ties to people are mentioned for the first time in the <em>Crónica de Castilla</em>. The value none signifies that the work contains no kinship information.<br>
                            Due to the common practice of expressing kinship via male relatives, this data can be explicit or inferred from familial/genealogical passages that mention the identified women. Passages with no references to women are not considered. If there is additional kinship information in subsequent mentions of women, the corresponding value is entered. Repeated kinship information in subsequent references is not recorded in this phase. When passages contain contradicting statements, an asterisk (*) is used to make the user aware of these inconsistencies. If the information on parents is inconclusive, a question mark (?) is placed after the recorded value. Users are advised to check the Notes field for explanations.

                            The field indicates how a person’s religion is determined. Possible values are <strong>saint, explicit</strong> (these two values require an explicit statement in the <em>Crónica de Castilla</em>), <strong>action/attitude</strong> (evidenced through actions such as prayer or expressions such as ‘serves God’), <strong>implicit</strong> (when religious affiliation is inferred—see the criteria below), <strong>probably</strong> (when it seems likely based on the context of the reference, but there is not enough information), and <strong>lacking information</strong> (for when no information is available). The only value that can be entered more than once per <u>Standard Name</u> is <strong>action/attitude.</strong><br>
                            For the value <strong>implicit</strong> to be recorded in the women’s first mention, two out of three criteria need to be fulfilled:

                            <li>Her recorded name is typical for a specific religious community;
                            <li>She is related by blood or marriage to members of that religious community, or her patronymics indicate a particular religious affiliation (e.g., Fernández &gt; the woman’s father is named Fernando &gt; he is Christian). In the case of anonymous groups, their men must be explicitly described as Christian, Muslim, or Jewish;</li>
                            <li>She is linked to places or realms that are representative of that religious community (note: due to shifting borders, these places need to be appropriately contextualized).</li>

                        <td>This field records mentions of personal characteristics understood as <strong>intellectual, physical</strong>, and <strong>moral</strong> (whether moral from the perspective of Christianity or courtly culture). These values are based on adjectives or descriptive statements in the chronicle, and they must not be confused with how somebody acts in a specific situation. Entries are also created when subsequent mentions of women refer to already recorded traits.</td>
